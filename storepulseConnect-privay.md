## Report an Issue
When reporting a bug, include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior and actual behavior
- Logs (if available)
- Screenshots or screen recording (without sensitive data)

## Store and Platform Services Transparency
StorePulse may rely on third-party platform services, including:
- Apple App Store and Google Play for in-app purchases and purchase restore
- Apple App Store Connect API for metrics retrieval (using credentials you provide in the app)

StorePulse is not Apple or Google and does not control outages, policy updates, billing flows, or platform-side interruptions.
If those services are unavailable or changed, sync, purchase, or restore flows may be affected.

StorePulse does not include third-party ad SDKs in the current version.

## Accessibility
Accessibility support is available.

## Data and Security Help
For data and privacy requests or questions, contact:

For local data removal:
- Uninstalling the app removes app sandbox data depending on platform behavior.
- You can also clear local content from in-app settings where available.
