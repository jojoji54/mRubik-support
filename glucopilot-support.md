# GlucoPilot Support

**Last updated: February 19, 2026**

## 1. Support and Contact

- Website: `https://mrrubik.dev`
- Email: `mrrubikdev@gmail.com`
- In-app support entry points: Settings -> Contact & Support

Support is handled on a best-effort basis. There is no guaranteed SLA.

## 2. Before You Contact Support

For faster troubleshooting, include:

- App version and build number.
- Platform and OS version (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows).
- Device model.
- Clear reproduction steps.
- Expected result vs actual result.
- Screenshots or screen recordings with sensitive health data removed.
- For sync issues: provider name (for example Dexcom/Libre/Apple Health/Health Connect/Fitbit/Oura/Garmin) and approximate timestamp.

## 3. Medical and Emergency Notice

GlucoPilot is not an emergency service and does not provide diagnosis or medication/dose instructions.

If you may be experiencing a medical emergency, contact local emergency services immediately.

## 4. Cloud, AI, and Third-Party Service Transparency

Some GlucoPilot features depend on third-party services that may have outages, delays, or policy changes outside our control, including:

- Apple App Store / Google Play (purchases, renewals, billing, restore flows).
- Firebase services (optional cloud sync, push orchestration, backend callables).
- OpenAI services (optional cloud drafting for GlucoGuide responses).
- External health/integration providers you authorize (for example CGM/wearable OAuth providers).

Service disruptions in these providers may affect related features in GlucoPilot.

## 5. Purchases and Subscription Support

For billing, renewals, cancellations, and refunds, contact your store provider directly:

- Apple App Store support.
- Google Play support.

GlucoPilot support can help with product configuration and entitlement state checks inside the app, but cannot override store billing decisions.

## 6. Privacy and Data Requests

GlucoPilot includes privacy controls in-app (Privacy Center), including:

- Data source controls.
- Retention settings.
- Full local data export.
- Local delete-all operation.

For privacy requests involving optional cloud data, contact:

- `mrrubikdev@gmail.com`

Please include the account context/device details needed to identify your request.

## 7. Accessibility

If you need help using GlucoPilot with assistive technologies, contact:

- `mrrubikdev@gmail.com`

Include your platform, OS version, and accessibility setup so we can reproduce your issue.

## 8. Security Reporting

If you discover a potential security issue, report it privately to:

- `mrrubikdev@gmail.com`

Please include reproduction details and avoid public disclosure until triage is completed.
